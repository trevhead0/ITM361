            failing grade. In the unlikely event that you discover a validation error or warning
            that is a genuine bug in the validator, you must acknowledge that bug in the memo that
            accompanies your project, and point to the relevant documentation, such as
            specifications or an existing reputable bug report, that your source is in fact correct.

            element that loads your JavaScript file, and possibly also your DOM-manipulation

          <li>
            Avoid using JavaScript to manipulate your CSS whenever possible. Limit JavaScript to
            manipulating the DOM, including adding and removing state classes, and keep style
            information and transitions where they belong: in your CSS file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or
            code-generators, no Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf frameworks). A JavaScript framework
            for basic DOM manipulation is permissible, such as jQuery or a lightweight alternative
            such as Umbrella JS or Shoestring.
